/*******************************************************************************

    Provides utilities to mock a network in unittests

    This module is based on the idea that D `interface`s can be used
    to represent a server's API, and that D `class` inheriting this `interface`
    are used to define the server's business code,
    abstracting away the communication layer.

    For example, a server that exposes an API to concatenate two strings would
    define the following code:
    ---
    interface API { public string concat (string a, string b); }
    class Server : API
    {
        public override string concat (string a, string b)
        {
            return a ~ b;
        }
    }
    ---

    Then one can use "generators" to define how multiple process communicate
    together. One such generator, that pioneered this design is `vibe.web.rest`,
    which allows to expose such servers as REST APIs.

    `localrest` is another generator, which uses message passing and threads
    to create a local "network".
    The motivation was to create a testing library that could be used to
    model a network at a much cheaper cost than spawning processes
    (and containers) would be, when doing integration tests.

    Control_Interface:
    When instantiating a `RemoteAPI`, one has the ability to call foreign
    implementations through auto-generated `override`s of the `interface`.
    In addition to that, as this library is intended for testing,
    a few extra functionalities are offered under a control interface,
    accessible under the `ctrl` namespace in the instance.
    The control interface allows to make the node unresponsive to one or all
    methods, for some defined time or until unblocked.
    See `sleep`, `filter`, and `clearFilter` for more details.

    Event_Loop:
    Server process usually needs to perform some action in an asynchronous way.
    Additionally, some actions needs to be completed at a semi-regular interval,
    for example based on a timer.
    For those use cases, a node should call `runTask` or `sleep`, respectively.
    Note that this has the same name (and purpose) as Vibe.d's core primitives.
    Users should only ever call Vibe's `runTask` / `sleep` with `vibe.web.rest`,
    or only call LocalRest's `runTask` / `sleep` with `RemoteAPI`.

    Implementation:
    In order for tests to simulate an asynchronous system accurately,
    multiple nodes need to be able to run concurrently and asynchronously.

    There are two common solutions to this, to use either fibers or threads.
    Fibers have the advantage of being simpler to implement and predictable.
    Threads have the advantage of more accurately describing an asynchronous
    system and thus have the ability to uncover more issues.

    When spawning a node, a thread is spawned, a node is instantiated with
    the provided arguments, and an event loop waits for messages sent
    to the Tid. Messages consist of the sender's Tid, the mangled name
    of the function to call (to support overloading) and the arguments,
    serialized as a JSON string.

    Note:
    While this module's original motivation was to test REST nodes,
    the only dependency to Vibe.d is actually to it's JSON module,
    as Vibe.d is the only available JSON module known to the author
    to provide an interface to deserialize composite types.

    The following functions do that.
